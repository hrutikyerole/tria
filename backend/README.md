# Express.js Multi-Server Sample

This project is a basic Express.js application structure that demonstrates how to set up a backend server with routing.

## Project Structure

```
backend
├── src
│   ├── app.js          # Entry point of the application
│   └── routes
│       └── index.js    # Defines application routes
├── package.json        # npm configuration file
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`. You can define your routes in `src/routes/index.js` and customize the application in `src/app.js`.
